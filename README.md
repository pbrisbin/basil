A skype bot.

**NOTE**: It [appears][] the API this project uses is no longer 
available. That means this project is effectively dead. If/when 
another API becomes available that works across Linux and OSX, I 
will revive the project.

## Installation

Basil is meant to be run from source. Ruby is interpreted, so there's 
not much technical difference to this approach.

It is recommended mainly because he expects `./plugins` and `./config` 
to exist and running from within a clone of this repo is the simplest, 
most transparent way to accomplish that.

To get started, please head over to the [wiki][].
